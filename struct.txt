The UniformGPUScheme.x are the files we mostly modified. Cover the origin file and disable the auto-generation to check the effect.

Vectorization-Based Optimization:
pre-req env: CUDA
The folder flagComp save the profiling result for flag/master branch, label 'non-prof' means disable the self-contained profiling.

Then the folder loopTest stores the toycase src. Only the inner for case stored since outer for just need to change the order of lines. Directly compiled by nvcc is valid, to compile the zfplib please refer to the readme
	The memCheck is the ncu profiling file used for checking the memory varification due to simd and non-simd.
	The perfTest is the ncu profiling to check the performance when we change the loop iter time.
	The simdTest is the nsys report for simd and non-simd case.

Communication-Based Optimization:
pre-req env: CUDA, MPI, openMP, zfplib 
The folder MPI-test store the profiling file for MPI origin and compressed(also compressed align mempry) test.
	The folder send-recv is the simple sender-receiver performance collection
	The benchmark is the baseline summary(self-contained profiling) for the origin code
	The overlap-dup is the summary for the origin overlap case and the overlap case with duplicated data
	The file cuda_random.cu is the test code for using zfpLib. To compile this, zfplib is needed.

The folder compression recorder is the mini-application which simulated the kernel operation. run make to compile
	The several nhaloN folder store part of the test result of nhalo = ncell/N. Also the figure which is used to varify the correctness.
	plot.py is used to plot the varification figure, used as python plot.py -i input.txt -o output.txt
